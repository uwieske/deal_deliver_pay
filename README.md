# deal_deliver_pay
This project is about creating a reliable trading process where untrusted parties (a seller and a buyer) are assured that payment will be received and purchased goods/services will be delivered at destination by leveraging blockchain technology and optionally by including third parties in the delivery chain who could attest to the trade or could mediate in case of a dispute.
